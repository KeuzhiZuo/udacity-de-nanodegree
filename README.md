# Udacity Data Engineer Nanodegree
This repo contains all the projects from Udacity [Data Engineer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-engineer-nanodegree--nd027)

## Project 1 - Data Modeling with Postgres
A startup called Sparkify wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. 
Their current data resides in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app, but there is not an easy way to query data. <br>
This project offers a solution to the above issue with a database schema and ETL pipeline. Please click [HERE](https://github.com/KeuzhiZuo/udacity-de-nanodegree-project/tree/main/Project%201) to view more details about this project.
