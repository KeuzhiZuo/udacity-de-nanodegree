## Project 1 - Data Modeling with Postgres
A startup called Sparkify who wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. 
Their current data resides in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs 
in their app, but there is not an easy way to query data.
This project offers a solution to the above issue with a database schema and ETL pipeline.
