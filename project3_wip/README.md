# Project 3: Data Warehouse

## Introduction

 Sparkify has grown their user base and song database and want to move their processes and data onto the cloud. The data resides in S3, in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app. 
 In this project, I am building an ETL pipeline that extracts Sparkify's data from S3, stages them in Redshift, and transforms data into a set of dimensional tables for their analytics team to continue finding insights in what songs their users are listening to.
